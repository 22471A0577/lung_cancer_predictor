Lung Cancer Risk Predictor Web Application

Project Overview:

This project demonstrates my skills in Data Analytics, Machine Learning, and Web Development.
The Lung Cancer Risk Predictor predicts the likelihood of lung cancer based on a user's health features and symptoms. Users interact with a clean, responsive web interface to input their health details, and the model predicts the risk in real-time.

This project is designed to showcase the end-to-end workflow: from data analysis, model building, to deploying a user-friendly interface with HTML & CSS.

Key Features:

Machine Learning Based Prediction:
Uses a trained ML model (Random Forest ) to predict lung cancer risk.

Interactive Web Interface:

Responsive HTML & CSS front-end

Users enter age, gender, and other health features

Real-time prediction with a risk meter visualizing the risk percentage

Risk Factors Display:

Highlights which factors contribute to the risk

Shows green safe indicators for non-risk factors

Health Tips Section:

Provides actionable tips to reduce lung cancer risk

Fully Reproducible:

Includes Google Colab code, dataset, trained model (.pkl), and web files
