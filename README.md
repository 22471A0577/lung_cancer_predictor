Lung Cancer Risk Predictor Web Application

Project Overview:

This project demonstrates my skills in  Machine Learning, Data Analytics, and Web Design.
The Lung Cancer Risk Predictor predicts the likelihood of lung cancer based on a user's health features and symptoms. Users interact with a clean, responsive web interface to input their health details, and the model predicts the risk in real-time.

This project is designed to showcase the end-to-end workflow: from Data cleaning ,data analysis, model building, to deploying a user-friendly interface with HTML & CSS.
